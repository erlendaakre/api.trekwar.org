            <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

            <p><b>Q: When will the game be ready?</b><br />
                A: Please see the <g:link url="development">Development</g:link> page for the latest estimates
            </p><p><b>Q: Can I sign up for alpha/beta testing?</b><br />
            A: Check the <g:link url="/">front page</g:link> to see if testers are currently accepted
        </p>
            <p><b>Q: Which era is the game set in?</b><br />
                A: After VOY/DS9, however early in the game you will be able to use older ship hulls (miranda class, early Klingon/Romulan ships, etc..)
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: How can you play as dominion while staying true to canon?, they only have 3 ship classes?</b><br />
                A: This was a problem before when the ship classes where static (Like in Birth Of The Federation) see question below. In addition the dominion got a "Breen Warship"
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: How many ship classes will there be?</b><br />
                A: Each faction will trough research eventually have discovered 4-6 different hulls (In addition to civilian hulls which all factions can use)
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Hulls?</b><br />
                A: To make a ship, you take a basic hull (like a galaxy class hull) this hull has some base stats + X number of equipment slots that you can fill up with components that you get from researching
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: How many components will there be?</b><br />
                A: So far there are 17-19 types of components (and most of these have 3 levels, depending on tech). There are also 20 faction components, here are some examples:
                Mining laser (Everyone) - Allows ships to collect minerals from asteroid fields
                Warp Core (Everyone) - Allows ships to travel faster than light, and provides some power for other components
                Ablative armor (Federation) - Superior armor, especially against energy weapons.
                Infiltration unit (Dominion) - Disables planetary defenses and lowers morale
                Plasma torpedoes (Romulan) - Powerful torpedo upgrade
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: So I can make a really fast ship with few weapons, or really slow and powerful battleships?</b><br />
                A: Yes, or extremely powerful sensor ships, cloaked infiltrators (if Romulan/Klingon), sensor jamming ships, patrol optimized ships, defense, etc.. Note: some components have a diminishing return. For example a ship with 12 warp cores will not go 12 times faster than a ship with just 1 warp core
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: And I can make armored troop transports and heavily shielded colonization ships with galaxy class hulls?</b><br />
                A: No.. That is, the components Cargo Hold, mining laser, Colonization module are all "Civilian components", this means they can only be put in civilian ships.. This is to prevent very powerful invasion/colonization ships
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: There are Civilian ships?</b><br />
                A: yes, 5 different hulls, each one better and with more slots than the previous. For example a high tech freighter can have more mining lasers and bigger cargo hold, and get the resources faster
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be a one-time fee or monthly payment?</b><br />
                A: Neither, the game will be completely free to play and open source.
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Open source?</b><br />
                A: Trekwar will be released under the <a class="external" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>, which means anyone can download the full source code to the game and make modifications to it and help make the game better.
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: What happens if a ship runs out of fuel?</b><br />
                A: It stops moving... :)
            </p>
            <p>All ships in a fleet will share deuterium, so if you bring another ship to the stranded one, they can join up and travel to the closest planet/starbase together
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be customizable races? or can I play as a minor race like Bajorans?</b><br />
                A: No, the current plan is for players to be able to play as one of the five factions mentioned below
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Can I play as the Dominion?</b><br />
                A: Yes, you can play as Dominion/Federation/Cardassian/Romulan/Klingon. Currently, and during the Beta test only Federation and Klingon will be playable.
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: What about copyright, can you just use the Star Trek IP like that?</b><br />
                A: I don't know, Paramount has usually been very generous regarding the use of Star Trek by it's fans, so may people are able to create non commercial fan fiction, videos and games using the Star Trek universe. This practice will hopefully/probably continue in the future =)
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: What about starbases?</b><br />
                A: They are not implemented yet, but there will most definitely be starbases in the game eventually, with lots of power to run all the weapons/shields/sensors you put in them, they will be more versatile, expensive and more important than they were in BOTF
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be 3d user controlled combat like in Birth Of The Federation?</b><br />
                A: No.. The game is designed to be run like BOTF (few players, fast turns) OR like a massive multiplayer online game (hundreds of players, and longer time between each turn) so much of the combat will take place when users are not at the computer, or when there are to many users to pause the game for combat.
                So all combat will be done automatically by the server, based on the individual ships (damage, shields, speed, agility, crew experience, etc..) and you will get detailed combat reports that tell you how the battle went
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be diplomacy like in BOTF in game?</b><br />
                A: No, as of right now the game will be about conquest and team play, but agreements can be made (and broken) trough in game chat or mail of course.
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be trade?</b><br />
                A: Not during Beta, and probably not for the first release. But being able to trade resources / ships is definitely something I would like to add. I also want to add NPC traders but this is currently in the idea phase (for example Ferengi traders offering to sell you stolen hull designs, special components. Individuals wanting to sell you information about your enemies, etc..)
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be a in-game tutorial?</b><br />
                A: There will be documentation (including a "quick start")on the web page before beta testing and release. There might be a basic tutorial in the first 1.0 release
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will the games have graphics, or be text based like Planetarion and those kinds of games?</b><br />
                A: The game will have simple 2D graphics, roughly comparable to Birth Of The Federation. Look at the <g:link url="screenshots">screenshots</g:link> to get the general idea
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will I have to download the game, or do I play online?</b><br />
                A: You will have to download a client(Windows/Linux/Mac) that connects to the server. You have to have an Internet connection in order to play the game
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Can I play the game trough a browser?</b><br />
                A: No, you have to download the game client which is a stand alone application
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: How will ship speeds work?</b><br />
                A: Unlike BOTF where the game speed will not be just 1 or 2. Depending on how many engines you stuffed into the ship, it can go from 0.1 to 1.7 tiles per turn
                For example: Ship X has a speed of 1.4.. It moves 1 tile, which uses up 1.0 movement.. it has 0.4 extra movement IF it moves next turn
                it moves 1 turn again, with a speed of 1.8 (using it's extra movement). It now has 0.8 extra movement
                Now when the ship moves it has a speed of 1.4 with a bonus of 0.8.. so it can move 2.2, it then moves 2 tiles, and has 0.2 bonus
                rinse and repeat
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will the game stay true to star trek canon?</b><br />
                A: Yes, it will stay as true to Star Trek as possible without causing major imbalance to the gameplay
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will the game be turned based or real time?</b><br />
                A: The game will be turn based strategy, actions (moving, fighting, building, researching, etc..) will only be executed once per turn. If a turn is 1 hour, you can log in, give your ship a move order, and if you log in after 6 hours, the ship will have moved 6 "tiles" on the map (depending on the ship's speed). If you are playing with 3-5 friends there will eventually be support for a "end turn" button as well, and games can be paused and resumed later.
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Can two federation players fight against each other?</b><br />
                A: Not currently, the game will focus on team based strategy, where your faction (which could be just you, or several players) fight the other factions
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will there be a LCARS type interface like on Birth Of The Federation?</b><br />
                A: No, sadly LCARS is not a very practical user interface and the BOTF interface looked terrible to be honest :) It would also take lots of time to make custom interfaces for all 5 factions, time which could instead be spent on making the game better
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Will the game have sounds and music?</b><br />
                A: Yes, the game will have sound effects, and a beautiful soundtrack made by <a href="http://www.alienhand.dk/">AlienHand</a>
            </p>
            <p><b>Q: Can anyone run a server?</b><br />
                A: Yes, you can download a server and run it on any computer, either for a few number of friends or a larger public server. I'm currently looking into the details of having public servers register with a central game server and/or having a single Trekwar.org user that you can use to play on ANY public running server.
