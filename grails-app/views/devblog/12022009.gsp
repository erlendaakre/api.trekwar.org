            <h3>February 12 2009</h3>
            <p>Deuterium has been added as a resource to the game. It is used to power the warp engines of starships</p>
            <p>The gas is acquired by a) owning a star system with a gas giant, or b) harvesting it directly from a nebula</p>
            <p>All starship hulls has a default deuterium tank, but additional tanks can be added for greater range</p>
            <p>Ships can also be equipped with bussard collectors which lets them harvest the gas directly... Ships can run out of gas and become stranded, but you will be able to transport deuterium to them if that happens.</p>
            <p>Ships/fleets automatically refill deuterium when in a friendly star system</p>
