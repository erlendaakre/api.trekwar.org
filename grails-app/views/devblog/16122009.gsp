            <p>Unfortunately it seems the game won't be ready for testing this year as intended, but progress is being made, and the new goal is to have alpha testing in January 2010</p>

            <p>I just finished adding the rest of the civilian and Klingon ships, and they all work as expected. There are some more structures and ship components to add, and two more complex tasks (making prototypes of both the sensor system and the combat resolution). Also ground combat and mining/deuterium harvesting should be in place before alpha.</p>
            <p>I might also fix up the starsystem box, so that it looks more like the fleetbox in the post below.</p>
