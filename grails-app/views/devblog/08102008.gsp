            <h3>October 08 2008</h3>
            <p>I've decided to implement a ship designing feature to the game. Instead of a faction just having a set number of possible starships, each faction will have 4-7 hulls that you can fit yourself with weapons/shields/engines/power/etc. from what you've researched.</p>

            <br />
            <p>A nasty memory leak in the game client was also fixed, and I'm currently redesigning / pimping the user interface. The new client now looks more like a game, and less like a Java application, and I'll be posting some screenshots on this page this November.</p>
