            <h3>April 23 2009</h3>
            <p>I got lots of programming done during my easter vacation</p>

            <ul><li>Shipdesigner now complete: screenshot
            </li><li>Added the sound system to the game, including music and some sounds
            </li><li>Added chat system screenshot
            </li><li>Found and processed the images for 32 ship hulls
            </li></ul>

            <p>I also started on a major undertaking, fixing the way star systems, planets and structures work</p>
            <p>Now each system will have X number of planets, and each planet has a little map where you can build structures</p>
            <p>The interface is almost done, just need to implement a way to show buildings in the queue and under construction on the map</p>

            <p>Also a big thank you for everyone who participated in the Minimap poll, the results where clear and the minimap will respect the fog of war for users/factions</p>
