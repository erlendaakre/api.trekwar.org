            <h3>October 03 2010</h3>
            <p>It's been far to long since the last update, I've been busy with work (and having another project outside work) for a while, but that project is almost done.</p>
            <p>So from now on I will be able to get more Trekwar stuff done, and maybe get it read for alpha testing by Christmas.</p>

            <h4>Sensor system</h4>
            <p>The sensor system and fog of war was recently implemented, but still needs some tweaking. Hopefully it will be done soon, and I can begin on the combat system and doing some fixing on the structure system.</p>
