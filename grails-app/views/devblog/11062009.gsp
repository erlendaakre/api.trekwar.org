            <h3>June 11 2009</h3>
            <p>I would like to thank everyone who have been helping out by answering the various polls I've created for the last 6 months. There has been some tough choices and your input has been invaluable while designing many aspects of the game.</p>
            <p>Here are the results from the latest 5 polls:</p>

            <h4>Native language</h4>
            <img src="/images/devblog/poll1.png" />
            <br/>
            <p>It will be very easy to make a new translation and it can be used by just restarting the client.</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>Factions</h4>
            <img src="/images/devblog/poll2.png" />
            <br/>
            <p>Wow, you people really like the Federation, so I guess Federation + Klingon will be the highest priority (for the alpha and beta testing)</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <img src="/images/devblog/poll3.png" />
            <br/>
            <p>Hopefully I will get to add lots of features, and it appears that Starbases and wormholes will be at the top of the list :)</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>Starsystem management</h4>
            <img src="/images/devblog/poll4.png" />
            <br/>
            <p>This was a hard one, the easiest would be to not manage buildings (just build them), but now I've added the option for you to disable some buildings if you need the power or workers for something else</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>Out of energy in starsystems</h4>
            <img src="/images/devblog/poll5.png" />
            <br/>
            <p>Latest poll, so not many replies yet.. but it seems you guys want the "standard" option for this, so if you don't have the power, your factories, research and special structures will be put offline.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>I will put a update on the development of the game itself in about a week, I am currently working on the Starsystem Management (where you build structures on planets, and manage your starsystem). Build queues are in (and will be limited by your research into construction technology), and you can enable/disable buildings. Need to automatically disable structures if you don't have the requirements (enough power, industry, research). If you don't have enough power structures will be disabled.. if you don't have enough research or industry (for support, maintenance, spare parts, etc..) maybe your labs/industry/power structures will have a certain % chance of blowing up :)</p>
            <p>Also the ability to demolish structures and upgrade them ("Basis farm" -> "advanced farm") needs to be implemented.</p>
