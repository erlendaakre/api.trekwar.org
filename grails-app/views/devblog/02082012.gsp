            <h3>August 02 2012</h3>
            <p>Lately I've been designing and starting to implement a side project called Trekwar Online</p>
            <p>This new project is a stand alone piece of software that will in the long run provide users with a web portal to register and manage their Trekwar accounts, view games played, statistics, achievements, server listings etc..</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Starting Small</h4>
            <p>In it's current form however Trekwar Online is simply an authentication service, this means that you just need one single account to be able to play on many different servers (Kinda like Minecraft or the Battlefield games).</p>
            <p>This system will be ready a bit after Alpha 2, and release 0.4.6 will will focus entirely on Trekwar Online</p>
            <p>Below you can see a more detailed description of how the authentication will work:</p>
            <div style="width: 960px; height: 720px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:960px; height:720px" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/4bb90500-501a-389b-8879-4db20a5a8150"></iframe><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/mind_mapping_software" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; display: inline-block; position: absolute; bottom: 5px; left: 5px;"><img alt="mind mapping software"title="Lucidchart online diagrams"style="width: 100px; height: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border-image: none; border: none; display: block"src="https://www.lucidchart.com/img/diagrams-lucidchart.png"/></a></div>

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>TrekwarOnline is being developed as a web service and web portal (using Grails), and all Trekwar Servers can use it to allow players to join the game.
            <br />
            A huge thanks to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> for donating an IntelliJ IDEA license to the project, which will be used for creating/maintaining the Web portal, online services and this website
